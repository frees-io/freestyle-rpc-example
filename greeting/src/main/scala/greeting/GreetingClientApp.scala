    // the returned stream until there are no more messages.

    // Client streaming RPCs where the client writes a sequence of messages and sends them
    // to the server, again using a provided stream. Once the client has finished writing the messages,
    // it waits for the server to read them and return its response.

    // Bidirectional streaming RPCs where both sides send a sequence of messages using a read-write stream.
    // The two streams operate independently, so clients and servers can read and write in whatever order
    // they like: for example, the server could wait to receive all the client messages before writing its
    // responses, or it could alternately read a message then write a message, or some other combination
    // of reads and writes. The order of messages in each stream is preserved.
